A collection of my notes and exercise attempts for Introduction to Statistical Learning.

Exercises and labs are presented in a Jupyter notebook using Python (instead of R).

Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, I'd recommend you use a virtual environment.  Written for Python 3.6.
